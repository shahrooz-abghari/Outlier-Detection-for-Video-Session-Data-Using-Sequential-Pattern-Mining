The following code is used to conduct the experiment for paper: "Outlier Detection for Video Session Data Using Sequential Pattern Mining". The paper is submitted to KDD 2018.

# Datasets
Due to confidentiality reasons data is not publicly accessible.

# Proposed Approach

The proposed approach has 6 steps as follows:
1. Data segmentation
2. Frequent sequential patterns finding
3. Frequent sequential patterns mapping
4. Most frequent and non-most frequent patterns finding
5. MFSPs clustering
6. Analysis of NMFSPs and oultier detection

The results of the execution of the proposed approach on data related to October 2016 is presented.
