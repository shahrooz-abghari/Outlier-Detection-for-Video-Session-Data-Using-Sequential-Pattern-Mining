**Abstract**
<p align="justify">The growth of Internet video and over-the-top transmission techniques has enabled online video service providers to deliver high quality video content to viewers. To maintain and improve the quality of experience, video providers need to detect unexpected issues that can highly affect the viewers’ experience. This requires analyzing massive amounts of video session data in order to find unexpected sequences of events. In this paper we combine sequential pattern mining and clustering to discover such event sequences. The proposed approach applies sequential pattern mining to find frequent patterns by considering contextual and collective outliers. In order to distinguish between the normal and abnormal behavior of the system, we initially identify the most frequent patterns. Then a clustering algorithm is applied on the most frequent patterns. The generated clustering model together with Silhouette Index are used for further analysis of less frequent patterns and detection of potential outliers. Our results show that the proposed approach can detect outliers at the system level.</p>

# Datasets
Due to confidentiality reasons data is not publicly accessible.

# Proposed Approach

The proposed approach has 6 steps as follows:
1. Data segmentation
2. Frequent sequential patterns finding
3. Frequent sequential patterns mapping
4. Most frequent and non-most frequent patterns finding
5. MFSPs clustering
6. Analysis of NMFSPs and oultier detection

The results of the execution of the proposed approach on data related to October 2016 is presented.
